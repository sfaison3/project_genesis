[MUSIC_PROMPTS_BY_GENRE]

HIP_HOP="
"West Coast heatwave with booming 808s, funky synth bass, and distorted vocal chops — think Dr. Dre meets Travis Scott in 2025. Mood: Swagger, Dominance."

"Dark, cinematic trap beat layered with haunting strings, glitchy hi-hats, and bass drops that shake your bones. Mood: Gritty, Powerful."

"Old-school NYC boom bap with a modern twist — crunchy snares, jazzy horns, and lyrical storytelling energy. Mood: Hustle, Confidence."

"High-energy club banger with Afrobeat-influenced percussion, pitched-up vocal samples, and a beat drop that hits like a freight train. Mood: Party, Unstoppable."

"Futuristic drill beat with icy synths, rapid hi-hat rolls, and cinematic FX — imagine Blade Runner meets Pop Smoke. Mood: Cold, Intense."
"


COUNTRY="
"Southern backroad anthem with stomping drums, dirty slide guitar, and an outlaw vibe — perfect for a bonfire brawl. Mood: Rowdy, Rebel."

"Modern country-pop hit with upbeat acoustic strums, catchy hooks, and arena-sized choruses — made to belt in a pickup truck. Mood: Free, Wild."

"Banjo-driven country rock with a pounding kick, electric guitar solos, and whiskey-fueled energy. Mood: Bold, Celebratory."

"High-octane bluegrass fusion with double-time fiddle riffs, foot-stomping rhythm, and explosive breakdowns. Mood: Fast, Fiery."

"Dark country trap with ominous Dobro slides, moody pads, and deep bass — Johnny Cash meets trap house. Mood: Mysterious, Menacing."
